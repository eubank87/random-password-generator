# random-password-generator

For this assignment we were asked to create a random password generator by writing code in javascript.

Using input from the user, parameters are set to an array within a function. A for loop is used to pass over the final array and randomize the characters. The function then returns a random string of characters and when the function is called, results are displayed in the text box on the screen.
